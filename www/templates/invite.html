        <h3>There are three types of users: Biz user (business owner or service provider) or a regular user. Business owners are users who own or represent a business registered in TriniBiz. Service Providers are skilled persons who offer services but do not have registered business. Regular users are simply all other users who neither own or represent a business nor service registered in TriniBiz, but rather consume these services or use the app as a consumer.</h3>
